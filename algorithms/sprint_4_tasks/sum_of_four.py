"""
Gosha has a favorite number S.
Help him find all the unique quadruples of numbers in the array that add up to the given number S.

Input Format
The first line contains the total number of array elements n (0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000).

The second line contains an integer S .

The third line contains the array itself. Each number is an integer and does not exceed 109 in absolute value.

Output Format
In the first line print the number of fours found.

In the following lines print the found fours. Numbers within the same quadruple must be sorted in ascending order.
Between themselves, the fours are ordered lexicographically.

Input Example:
8
10
2 3 2 4 1 10 3 0
