The Levenshtein distance between two strings s and t is the number of atomic changes that can be used to turn one string
into another. Atomic changes mean: removing one character, inserting one character, replacing one character with another.

Find the Levenshtein distance for the given pair of strings.

Print a single number â€” the distance between the lines.

Input example:
abacaba
abaabc

Time complexity:
O(n*m), where m and n - string lengths

Space complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the shortest string
