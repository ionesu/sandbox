You are given strings packed. Let's define a packed string (CL) recursively.
A string consisting of only lowercase English letters is an ES.
If A and B are correct CSs, then AB is also a CS.
If A is an ES and n is a single-digit natural number, then n[A] is also an ES.
In this case, the notation n[A] means that when unpacking, the string A is written n times in a row.
Find the largest common prefix of the unpacked strings and print it (unpacked).

In other words, let addition be the concatenation of two strings, and multiplying a string by a number is the repetition
of the string the appropriate number of times. Let the function f be able to receive an AP and unpack it.
If ES D has the form D=AB, where A and B are also ESs, then f(D) = f(A) + f(B). If D=n[A], then f(D) = f(A) Ã— n.

Input example:
3
2[a]2[ab]
3[a]2[r2[t]]
a2[aa3[b]]

Time complexity:
O(n*m), where n - number of strings, m - length of longest string
Space complexity:
O(m), where m - length of longest string
